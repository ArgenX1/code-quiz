# code-quiz

## Description
This project was very difficult for me, I spent a lot of time on it and in the end got it done and working.
This quiz really firmmed up my understanding of DOM manipulation and how it works. I still am having a hard time understanding arrays and how they work but this project pushed me to get a better grip on it.

## Usage

Click the start button to start the quiz.
Answer correctly it displays correct and you move to the next question.
Answer incorrectly and it takes 10 sec off the timer and displays wrong until you get it correct.
At the end the timer stops and that is your score, click finish to go to the highscore page and enter your score or click restart to try again.

## Credits

Thanks to my study group for helping me with things I needed help with. I tried to do most of this project myself so that I could better understand what was happening instead of just copying it or doing it because it works.

Also big shout out to Jandy and Louis for helping me go the extra mile of ordering my highscore list when it wasn't part of the assignment!
